# Toy Robot Project with Python and Turtle Graphics

This is a simple project that simulates a toy robot using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The robot can move around a 2D grid, turn left or right, and change its direction. The grid also contains obstacles that the robot needs to navigate around.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Usage

To run the project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the simulation and open a new window with the Turtle graphics canvas. You can use the following commands to control the robot:

- `FORWARD`: move the robot forward by one step
- `BACKWARD`: move the robot backward by one step
- `LEFT`: turn the robot left by 90 degrees
- `RIGHT`: turn the robot right by 90 degrees
- `OFF`: turn off the simulation and exit the program

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a command. Simply type one of the commands above and press enter to control the robot.

If the robot encounters an obstacle, you will need to manually guide it around the obstacle.

## Examples

Here are some examples of commands you can use to control the robot:

```
> FORWARD
```

This will move the robot forward by one step.

```
> LEFT
```

This will turn the robot left by 90 degrees.

```
> OFF
```

This will turn off the simulation and exit the program.
